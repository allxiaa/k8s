| NAME                    | PROMPT      | DESCRIPTION | EXAMPLE |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------- | 
| app | ``` Create manifest k8s for an application Demo gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0 ``` | The deployment app "Demo" from image gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0 | [app.yaml](https://github.com/allxiaa/k8s/blob/main/app.yaml)|
| app-livenessProbe | ``` Create an http livenessProbe for port 8080 and show it to me this like the k8s manifest ``` | The deployment add liveness probe | [app-livenessProbe.yaml](https://github.com/allxiaa/k8s/blob/main/app-livenessProbe.yaml) |
| app-readinessProbe | ``` Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest for an application using the image `gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0`. The deployment should: Expose port 8080. Include an HTTP readiness probe that checks the `/ready` endpoint after an initial delay of 20 seconds, with a check interval of 5 seconds and a failure threshold of 3. ``` | The deployment add readiness probe | [app-readinessProbe.yaml](https://github.com/allxiaa/k8s/blob/main/app-readinessProbe.yaml) |
| app-volumeMounts | ``` Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest for an application using the image `gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0`. The deployment should: volume mounts Mydata ``` | The volume mounts Mydata | [app-volumeMounts.yaml](https://github.com/allxiaa/k8s/blob/main/app-volumeMounts.yaml) |
| app-cronjob | ``` Create task in cronjob when run ever y 7 minute clean.sh  like the k8s manifest ``` | Every 7 minutes run clean.sh | [app-cronjob.yaml](https://github.com/allxiaa/k8s/blob/main/app-cronjob.yaml) |
| app-job | ``` Create a job as manifest k8s ``` | A job run "your-command" with arg1 and arg2 | [app-job.yaml](https://github.com/allxiaa/k8s/blob/main/app-job.yaml) |
| app-multicontainer | ``` Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest for an application that includes multiple containers. The deployment should: - Use the NGINX image ("nginx:latest") as the main application container, exposing port 80. - Include a liveness probe that checks the root path ("/") on port 80 after an initial delay of 30 seconds, with a check interval of 10 seconds and a failure threshold of 3. - Add a second container using the BusyBox image that tails a log file located at "/var/log/app.log". - Use a shared "emptyDir" volume to store logs, mounted at "/var/log" in the logging container. - Set the number of replicas to 3.  ``` | Run 2 containers  | [app-multicontainer.yaml](https://github.com/allxiaa/k8s/blob/main/app-multicontainer.yaml) |
| app-resources | ``` Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest for an application using the image gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0. The deployment should: Specify resource limits of 256Mi for memory and 100m for CPU, and requests of 128Mi for memory and 100m for CPU. ``` | The resource sets limit: 100m for CPU and  256Mi for memory and requests of 128Mi for memory and 100m for CPU  | [app-resources.yaml](https://github.com/allxiaa/k8s/blob/main/app-resources.yaml) |
| app-secret-env | ``` Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest for an application that will be provided with a secret: specifically, env SECRET_USERNAME from the secret named mysecret1 with the key username, and SECRET_PASSWORD from the secret named mysecret1 with the key password. ``` | Use mysecret1 ``` export SECRET_USERNAME=username; export SECRET_PASSWORD=password ``` | [app-secret-env.yaml](https://github.com/allxiaa/k8s/blob/main/app-secret-env.yaml) |
